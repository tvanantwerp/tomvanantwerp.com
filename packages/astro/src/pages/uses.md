## Programming

- I mostly work with **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. Within the world of JS, I often use **React** (sometimes as part of Next.js or Gatsby) and **D3**. I've also got experience with **Node** on the backend.
- I've also used **Python** for scraping, data cleaning, and sometimes backend work like with Django.
- I can use PHP if I must...

## Hardware

- Apple MacBook Pro with M1 Max, 2021 model
- Apple iMac 2017 model with 27-inch 5k display
- [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://amzn.to/3QikBAC). Previously I used a [Keychron K1](https://amzn.to/3qaYS2K) mechanical keyboard, but one of the switches started to stick in a bad way!
- [Logitech MX Vertical Wireless Mouse](https://amzn.to/3QgQYiQ), a "shark fin" style mouse for when regular mice have worn your wrist out
- [Google Pixel 6 Pro](https://amzn.to/3QkYV6G)
- [Bose QuietComfort 35](https://amzn.to/47dSQ1R) noise-cancelling headphones with [Wicked Cushions replacement ear pads](https://amzn.to/47c5QFq), used mainly at my desk
- [Sony WF-1000XM3](https://amzn.to/44QIB1Z) noise-cancelling earbuds used mainly on the go, with [Comply TrueGrip Pro Memory Foam Tips](https://amzn.to/44MJWqH) to not fall out of my apparently massive earholes
- [APC BX850M Battery Backup and Surge Protector](https://amzn.to/44JjXQJ) (which uses [RBC17 replacement batteries](https://amzn.to/452l7Xq)) to keep my equipment running during power outages
- [Sakura Pigma 005 pens](https://amzn.to/457BbqM), which are great for tiny writers like me who hate to see their letters bleed together
- [A6 Spiral-bound Dot Grid Notebooks](https://amzn.to/457HGtE) are perfect for daily time-block planning
- [Muji A5 gridded notebooks](https://amzn.to/3Dza6B9) for everyday scribbling
- [Rhodia A5 dot grid notebook](https://amzn.to/43HpkPj) for more substantial journaling
- [Autonomous.ai SmartDesk 2](https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-home), bamboo top with black frame

## Software

- A password manager—I'm not saying which. If you're not using one already, just pick one and go for it!
- I write most code in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Aside from language support, I use these extensions for quality of life improvements.
  - [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot), though honestly I turn it off a lot. Good Intellisense beats Copilot.
  - [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) to respect any `.editorconfig` settings.
  - [Pretty TypeScript Errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors)
  - [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)
  - [Color Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight)
  - [indent-rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)
  - [Rainbow CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv)
  - [Trailing Spaces](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shardulm94.trailing-spaces)
- [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) with [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) shell.
- [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/about) is great for spaced repetition, an excellent way to [memorize things](https://ncase.me/remember/).
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is my primary browser, and my favorite add-on is [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) for content blocking.
- I use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control, [GitHub](https://github.com/tvanantwerp) as a place to keep my repositories, and [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) as a GUI because I'm lazy in that way.
- I've been using [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) (and it's previous incarnations) since the early 2000s, including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Premiere.

## Cooking

- Almost anything is easy to cook with minimal mess using a combination of an [air fryer](https://amzn.to/3Kkg3WB), [pressure cooker](https://amzn.to/3q9CC9r), and [sous vide](https://amzn.to/3OB9iSP) and [12 quart container](https://amzn.to/3OB9jWT).
- For an easy way to cook veggies, pour a bag of your preferred frozen veggies into a hot oiled [wok](https://amzn.to/3qdQHm8) for around ten minutes. I add salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and soy sauce for extra flavor. If I've already got some leftover meat—usually pulled pork—I'll add that in too.
- [Müeller Vacuum Sealer](https://amzn.to/3DG0aWp) for preparing food for sous vide, or for storage.
- Some good general accessories: [OXO Tongs](https://amzn.to/479BFi0), [Kuhn Rikon soft edge slotted spatula](https://amzn.to/3rRHLDB)
- I'm a weirdo who tracks literally everything I eat to the gram. The [OXO food scale](https://amzn.to/3QnPrYB) makes that a lot easier.
- My current coffee stack:
  - [Swing's Silent Cal decaf](https://amzn.to/479h2Cu), which is both an excellent decaf and easy to procure as I live close to them.
  - [Capresso electric grinder](https://amzn.to/3Qjatr9), because my wife kept complaining what a pain it is to manually grind beans with my [Hario coffee mill](https://amzn.to/3QiuPku).
  - [Electric kettle](https://amzn.to/3YcTLeR8)
  - [AeroPress](https://amzn.to/44Mo9PJ)
  - [Diner-style mug](https://amzn.to/3rFcgfN)
  - In the past I've also used a [Chemex](https://amzn.to/44L4BeJ), but I broke it and haven't replaced it yet.

## Fitness

- For tracking fitness data, I use: the [Oura Ring](https://ouraring.com/discount/8e4373243d) (third generation) for tracking sleep and activity; [Greater Goods WiFi Smart Scale](https://amzn.to/3Oa9GWV); a [body measuring tape](https://amzn.to/3Qg87cw) for recording things like arm, leg, and waist circumference; and [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) for tracking my diet and consolidating fitness data from other apps.
- I mostly lift dumbbells at home. I've also got a [bench](https://amzn.to/3QcI6Le), a [pull-up bar](https://amzn.to/47depj6), and [resistance bands](https://amzn.to/472q3xc).
- For working on tight muscles, I use a [TriggerPoint Foam roller](https://amzn.to/3rV7KtF).
