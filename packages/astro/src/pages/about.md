Tom is a software engineer and technologist living and working around Washington, DC. Since 2004, he's been designing and coding websites, creating interactive data visualizations, and building out IT infrastructure. His interests include: the kind of smart, walkable, mixed-use urbanism that's illegal to build in most American cities; and his dog [Oreo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqnBR0SD5xo).
