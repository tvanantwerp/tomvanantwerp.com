## The Problem

[Link to original problem on Leetcode.](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Example 1:

```
  3
 / \
9   20
   / \
  15  17

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```

Example 3:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

## My Solution

This solution is fairly straightforward with a queue. We need a variable to store the child nodes that we haven't yet traversed on a given level, and we can initialize it with the root node. As long as the queue has values in it, we've still got nodes to processâ€”so we'll go over it with a while loop. Each iteration of the while loop drains the queue of nodes in the current level, and refills it with nodes on the next level.

```typescript
// Define our TreeNode class, provided from leetcode
class TreeNode {
	val: number;
	left: TreeNode | null;
	right: TreeNode | null;
	constructor(val?: number, left?: TreeNode | null, right?: TreeNode | null) {
		this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
		this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
		this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
	}
}

function levelOrder(root: TreeNode | null): number[][] {
	// No root node? Return empty string.
	if (!root) return [];

	const output = [];
	// We'll use an array to queue up nodes we haven't checked.
	const queue = [root];

	// For any given iteration of the while loop, our queue will
	// contain all of the nodes on that level.
	while (queue.length) {
		// This variable will hold the values at this level.
		const levelOutput = [];
		// We save the current queue length, because we'll need
		// it in the for loop; but the queue itself will
		// be modified throughout, and its length would change.
		const levelLength = queue.length;
		for (let i = 0; i < levelLength; i++) {
			// Grab the first item in our queue. Push it's value to
			// the levelOutput variable, then add its child nodes
			// to the queue if they exist.
			const node = queue.shift();
			levelOutput.push(node.val);
			if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
			if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
		}
		// Add this level's values into our output array.
		output.push(levelOutput);
	}

	return output;
}
```

If you want to get fancy, you can get the same results with a few array methods. This shouldn't be quite as time efficient, since it loops over everything in the queue twice during the while loop versus once in the previous solution. But I do so enjoy using array methods!

```typescript
function levelOrder(root: TreeNode | null): number[][] {
	if (!root) return [];
	const output = [];
	let queue = [root];
	while (queue.length) {
		output.push(queue.map(node => node.val));
		queue = queue.flatMap(node => {
			return [node.left, node.right].filter(n => n !== null);
		});
	}
	return output;
}
```
