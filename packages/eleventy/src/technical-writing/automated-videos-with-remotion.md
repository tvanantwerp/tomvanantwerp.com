Once upon a time, nearly 20 years ago, I was into videography. YouTube was hardly a thing, and my high school had me in a program that gave me access to high-end cameras and Adobe Premiere Pro. I had fun making stupid films and sharing them at school, but I didn't really stick with it after going to college. I got serious and studied business—and after realizing what a mismatch for my personality that was, pivoted into programming. But seeing the incredible variety of videos on YouTube makes me miss my days making them myself. I no longer have fancy cameras or a license to Adobe Creative Cloud. But what I do have is an intimate knowledge of [React](https://reactjs.org/)—and as it turns out, that will be enough. Enter [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/): a tool for creating videos with React code.

I was inspired to try Remotion after discovering a particularly niche genre of YouTube videos: timers. Yeah, just videos counting down in pre-defined increments. Just Googling "timer" only seems to trigger their built-in timer tool half the time for me, which is how I found these videos. I guess some folks are happy to have a video timer instead of an alternative. But I thought, "Hey, I bet I could make _a lot_ of timer videos programmatically." And that's what we're going to do!
