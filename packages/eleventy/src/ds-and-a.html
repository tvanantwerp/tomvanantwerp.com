<p>
	I don't know if anybody enjoys doing technical interviews. But I
	<em>do</em> enjoy solving code puzzles in my own time, just for fun! Here is a
	list of problems I've gone through, including an explanation of how I solved
	each one.

<ul class="writing__collection__list writing__collection__list--columns">
	{% assign posts = collections['Coding Questions'] | sortByTitle %} {% for post
	in posts %}
	<li>
		{% if post.data.emoji %}{{post.data.emoji}}{% endif %}
		<a href="{{post.url | url }}">{{post.data.title}}</a>
	</li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>
