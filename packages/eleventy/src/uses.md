## Programming

- I mostly work with **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**. Within the world of JS, I often use **React** (sometimes as part of Next.js or Gatsby) and **D3**. I've also got experience with **Node** on the backend.
- I've also used **Python** for scraping, data cleaning, and sometimes backend work like with Django.
- I can use PHP if I must...

## Hardware

- Apple MacBook Pro mid-2015 model

## Software

- A password manager—I'm not saying which. If you're not using one already, just pick one and go for it!
- I write most code in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Aside from language support, I use these extensions for quality of life improvements.
  - [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)

- I use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control, [GitHub](https://github.com/tvanantwerp) as a place to keep my repositories, and [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) as a GUI because I'm lazy in that way.
- I've been using [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) (and it's previous incarnations) since the early 2000s, including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Premiere.

## Cooking

- Almost anything is easy to cook with minimal mess using a combination of an [air fryer](http://www.tidylife.cc/products/air-fryer-1855a/?tax=af1855a), [pressure cooker](https://amzn.to/31okg4H), and [sous vide](https://amzn.to/3sykTV5) and [12 quart container](https://amzn.to/3sykUID).
- For an easy way to cook veggies, pour a bag of your preferred frozen veggies into a hot oiled [wok](https://amzn.to/3cyfyrv) for around ten minutes. I add salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and soy sauce for extra flavor.
- [Müeller Vacuum Sealer](https://amzn.to/37odgaL) for preparing food for sous vide, or for storage.
- Some good general accessories: [OXO Tongs](https://amzn.to/3rx1gbm), [Kuhn Rikon soft edge slotted spatula](https://amzn.to/3ddnUnl)
- I'm a weirdo who tracks literally everything I eat to the gram. The [OXO food scale](https://amzn.to/3w189Zr) makes that a lot easier.
- My current coffee stack:
  - [Swing's Silent Cal decaf](https://amzn.to/3dbPbXp), which is both an excellent decaf and easy to procure as I live close to them.
  - [Capresso electric grinder](https://amzn.to/3flkKR9), because my wife kept complaining what a pain it is to manually grind beans with my [Hario coffee mill](https://amzn.to/3tYFTVm).
  - [Electric kettle](https://amzn.to/3lZN7W8)
  - [AeroPress](https://amzn.to/3tZNymf)
  - [Diner-style mug](https://amzn.to/3dc5zXF)
  - In the past I've also used a [Chemex](https://amzn.to/3d9kS3s), but I broke it and haven't replaced it yet.

## Fitness

- For tracking fitness data, I use: the [Oura Ring](https://ouraring.com/) (first generation) for tracking sleep and activity; [Weight Gurus Smart Scale](https://amzn.to/39ljxpe); a [body measuring tape](https://amzn.to/2NZ7vdx) for recording things like arm, leg, and waist circumference; and [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) for tracking my diet and consolidating fitness data from other apps.
- I mostly lift dumbbells at home. I've also got a [bench](https://amzn.to/3lWtaQ4), a [pull-up bar](https://amzn.to/3swoqDh), and [resistance bands](https://amzn.to/31wzdRX).
- For working on tight muscles, I use a [TriggerPoint Foam roller](https://amzn.to/3fhJbPq).
