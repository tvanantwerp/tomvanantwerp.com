## The Problem

[Link to original problem on Leetcode.](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

<summary>Examples</summary>

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

## My Solution

A leetcode problem with a story! This is quite rare, and a real treat![^1] This is a dynamic programming problem, and as such we can solve it either recursively or iteratively.

### Recursive Solution

To solve this problem recursively, we should think about what sub-problem we're trying to solve. Whenever I'm at a house at `index`, I have to decide: am I better off robbing this house, or waiting until I get to the next house? If I rob this house, I get the value of its possessions `nums[index]`, plus the value of all the houses I robbed before if the last house I robbed was the house from two before it at `nums[index - 2]`. If I skip this house, I get the value of all the houses I robbed before this house ending at the house immediately before it at `nums[index - 1]`. If `index` starts at the last value of `nums`, then we can write a recursive function to figure out the sum of the best sequence of houses by working back from `index`. I can work backward until I'm out of houses to compareâ€”that is to say, the `index` is less than `0`. That's our base case.

```typescript
function rob(nums: number[], index?: number): number {
	// This function is modified to accept a second argument
	// from how it's scaffolded in leetcode: index. Because
	// leetcode will give no index value, we check to see
	// if it is undefined before we begin our own recursive
	// comparisons.
	if (index !== undefined) {
		if (index < 0) {
			// Indices less than zero are the base case; we are
			// out of houses to rob! Non-existant houses have
			// a value of zero.
			return 0;
		} else {
			// If we're not yet out of houses to rob, we return the
			// maximum of this house plus the house two before, or
			// the house one before. We recursively call the function
			// to get the sum of other house's values.
			return Math.max(
				rob(nums, index - 2) + nums[index],
				rob(nums, index - 1)
			);
		}
	} else {
		// If index wasn't defined, this means our function is
		// being executed for the first time. We call it again,
		// but this time with a starting index.
		return rob(nums, nums.length - 1);
	}
};
```

This function is correct, but it's not performant. If you try running it in leetcode, it will time out. We need to improve it with memoization.

### Recursive Solution + Memoization

To improve on the previous solution, we add memoization to remember values we've previously computed. This dramatically speeds up our solution. Here, we pass around a `Map` with the `index` as key and the result of our comparisons as the value.

```typescript
function rob(nums: number[], index?: number, memo?: Map<number, number>): number {
	if (index !== undefined) {
		if (index < 0) {
			return 0;
		} else if (memo.has(index)) {
			return memo.get(index)
		} else {
			const result = Math.max(
				rob(nums, index - 2, memo) + nums[index], rob(nums, index - 1, memo)
			);
			memo.set(index, result);
			return result
		}
	} else {
		return rob(nums, nums.length - 1, new Map<number, number>());
	}
};
```
