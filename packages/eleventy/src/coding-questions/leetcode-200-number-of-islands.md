## The Problem

[Link to original problem on Leetcode.](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

<summary>Examples</summary>

Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

<summary>Constraints</summary>


- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
</details>

## My Solution

### Depth First Search

This problem is fairly straightforward. We can just start iterating through the grid, and calling a depth first search function `dfs` on any cell equal to `'1'`. Our `dfs` function mutates the grid to make any visited square equal to neither `'0'` nor `'1'`. This means that we'll only ever call `dfs` on a contiguous island once, as future visits to cells that are part of the island won't trigger the function call anymore. We simply store the number of these initial calls to `dfs` in a `count` variable and return it to get the number of islands.

```typescript
function numIslands(grid: string[][]): number {
	let count = 0;
	for (let row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
		for (let column = 0; column < grid[0].length; column++) {
      // Since we overwrite grid cells in our dfs function,
      // the first piece of land we find for every island
      // is the only time we call dfs inside this loop
      // directly. Thus, we can increment count by one here.
			if (grid[row][column] === '1') {
				count++;
				dfs(grid, row, column);
			}
		}
	}

	return count;
}

function dfs(matrix: string[][], row: number, column: number) {
  // We return early if we have invalid coordinates or water.
	if (
		row < 0 ||
		column < 0 ||
		row >= matrix.length ||
		column >= matrix[0].length ||
		matrix[row][column] !== '1'
	)
		return;

  // Otherwise, we mutate the value of the matrix at the
  // coordinates so we won't accidentally count it again later.
  // This ensures we call dfs from numIslands just once per
  // island. After mutation, we recursively call dfs again on
  // the cells above, below, left, and right of the current
  // cell.
	matrix[row][column] = 'âœ…';
	dfs(matrix, row + 1, column);
	dfs(matrix, row - 1, column);
	dfs(matrix, row, column + 1);
	dfs(matrix, row, column - 1);
}
```
