The [Tax Foundation's website](https://taxfoundation.org) has served nearly 50 million visitors since Tom VanAntwerp rebuilt it in early 2017. It's been the primary publication platform for the organization, which has worked to inform public policy around taxation since 1937.

This was both a platform migration and a redesign.
