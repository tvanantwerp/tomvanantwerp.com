At my heaviest over 15 years ago, I weight between 200 and 210 pounds.

I don't remember the exact figureâ€”it was not a time in my life where I tracked that sort of thing. Growing up in a small-to-medium size Southern city, it wasn't abnormal to be overweight. While I wasn't happy with my appearance, I wasn't alarmed either. And there was no one in my life to tell me: "Hey, kid, you really need to lose some weight so that you'll look good and feel good and not get metabolic syndrome." To this day, I do not think my mother was ever aware that I was fat, despite being at the border between overweight and obese.[^1]

I struggled with my weight, gaining and losing and gaining again, for years. I managed to lose weight mostly by accident of circumstance in late high school and college, but it crept back during my early career due to bad eating habits and too much time at a desk. In early 2019, I was done letting my health be a non-priority. I'd read enough by then to know what I needed to do, and I set about making permanent changes to my lifestyle that persist to this day. Where I was once over 200 pounds, I now average 155.

**Disclaimer**: This article shares everything I didâ€”right and wrongâ€”to get my weight where I want it and replace flab with muscle. I'm not a nutritionist, a personal training, or a medical professional. What works for me may not work for you. This is only a personal account, which I hope will inspire people who find themselves in the same situation I was in.

## Accidental Weight Loss During Youthful Ignorance

My first major weight loss, from 210 to 180, happened in late high school. It wasn't something I planned. I was such a nerdâ€”with no confidence in my physical abilityâ€”that I don't think I believed weight loss was possible. It happened because of the popularity of [Dance Dance Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02ndthPNTVM) (DDR) in my school. I've always been a gamer, and for the first time I'd found a form of exercise thatâ€”by way of being a video gameâ€”I neither hated nor found myself bad at.[^2]

I bought a cheap padded dance mat for the Playstation 2 (and later a USB adpater to hook it up to my PC and the software Stepmania), and started playing for half an hour daily. DDR is essentially a form of [high-intensity interval training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training), and playing it was my first introduction to the concept. Each song was roughly 3 minutes, with alternative periods of easier and more intense footwork. A few songs in, and I was sweaty and breathless. But because the game aspect occupied my mind in a way that PE class never did, I was able to keep going song after songâ€”until my brain was telling my feet where to go but they just couldn't get there in time. That's when I'd call it a day. After months of playing, I had lost a lot of weight and gotten [very good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ICTbPfrZ0).

DDR was a high-quality introduction to exercise. I'm still tempted to buy a nice metal dance padâ€”except that I would probably drive my wife mad using it.[^3] But DDR alone does not make for a healthy lifestyleâ€”I still ate like crap and didn't really understand anything about fitness. I'd fallen into a good workout routine by accident, and I fell right back out of it when I left for college.

Lots of people complain about the freshmen fifteen, but I mercifully experienced the opposite. By the end of freshman year, I weighed close to 165 pounds. Again, this was an accident. I did not realize at the time what I was doing. What happened? Simply, I was too lazy to eat.

I had no kitchen and only a mini-fridge in my dorm room, so I couldn't keep much food there. And I was usually too engrossed in video games or other computer use to actually go out and pick up something to eat. Freed from my mother's cookingâ€”three large meals a day whether I was hungry or notâ€”I started eating less, and less often. In hindsight, I had begun [time-restricted feeding](https://peterattiamd.com/intermittent-fasting/).[^4] Oversimplified: restricting the times you eat during the day helps to stabilize and reduce insulin throughout the day, allowing your body to use stored fat rather than try to store even more.

I didn't whave a college workout routine. I did pick up the habit of walking, everywhere and often. And that's certainly healthy for body and mind, but the calorie burn from that would have been minimal. My HIIT routine from DDR was gone, and I failed at every other attempt to build a new routine.

Looking back, I really had no idea what I was doing regarding exercise. I would start by going to a campus gym (which I never felt comfortable entering due to self-consciousness around my appearance and lack of knowledge), and usually getting on a treadmill. I have always hated doing steady-state cardio, so of course I had little motivation to show up the first time, much less the second, third, etc. I don't think I ever touched any weights or machines, which I now know I really enjoy.

## Early Career and the Return of Weight

After college, both my diet and physical activity took a hit. Employment is not so leisurely as college, so a lot of the time I had spent walking to the local co-op to get something healthy-ish from the hot bar was replaced with a quick trip to the sandwich place catty-corner to my office, which was aptly named [Potbelly](https://www.potbelly.com/). I didn't weight myself for many of these years, but by late 2018 I was back up to 180 pounds and trending upward. I was very unhappy with my appearance, and I was feeling myriad health effects from sitting at a desk all day. It was beginning to dawn on me that I was getting older, and that now was the time to make physical fitness a central part of my life if I didn't want to succumb to pain and illness down the road.

[^1]: A few years ago, when my maternal grandmother died, I attended her funeral and saw much of my extened family for the first time in a long time. I was 164 pounds (little of it muscle) at the time, and so comparably thin next to my cousins that people thought I was sick or had cancer. Note that I was in no way skinnyâ€”I still had a gut sticking outâ€”I was just _so much skinnier_ than the others there.

[^2]: Unlike [Bobby Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02ndthPNTVM), by the time I first set foot in Japan, DDR was retro and nowhere to be found. I remain very disappointed that I never got to hustle any Japanese people at DDR, pretending to be a big clumsy gaijin before busting a move.

[^3]: I've tried virtual reality, and it doesn't compare to DDR in terms of intensity. [Thrill of the Fight](https://sealostinteractive.com/) is the only VR game I've played that gets my heart rate high, but it's mostly an arm workout and a bit dangerous if you accidentally punch a wall. [Pistol Whip](https://cloudheadgames.com/pistol-whip/) is an alright squat workout, but does almost nothing to my heart rate. I'm hopefuly more and better fitness games come along with time, but it will be hard to replicate the effects of DDR.

[^4]: Most people call this intermittent fasting, but [I agree with Dr. Peter Attia](https://peterattiamd.com/intermittent-fasting/) that only eating in a narrow range of hours each day isn't much of a fast. No eating for 24 hours or more? That's a fast. Skipping breakfast every day? Mere time-restriction.
