At my heaviest over 15 years ago, I weight between 200 and 210 pounds.

I don't remember the exact figureâ€”it was not a time in my life where I tracked that sort of thing. Growing up in a small-to-medium size Southern city, it wasn't abnormal to be overweight. While I wasn't happy with my appearance, I wasn't alarmed either. And there was no one in my life to tell me: "Hey, kid, you really need to lose some weight so that you'll look good and feel good and not get metabolic syndrome." To this day, I do not think my mother was ever aware that I was fat, despite being at the border between overweight and obese.[^1]

I struggled with my weight, gaining and losing and gaining again, for years. I managed to lose weight mostly by accident of circumstance in late high school and college, but it crept back during my early career due to bad eating habits and too much time at a desk. In early 2019, I was done letting my health be a non-priority. I'd read enough by then to know what I needed to do, and I set about making permanent changes to my lifestyle that persist to this day. Where I was once over 200 pounds, I now average 155.

**Disclaimer**: This article shares everything I didâ€”right and wrongâ€”to get my weight where I want it and replace flab with muscle. I'm not a dietician, a personal trainer, nor a medical professional of any kind. What works for me may not work for you. This is only a personal account, which I hope will inspire people who find themselves in the same situation I was in.

## Accidental Weight Loss During Youthful Ignorance

My first major weight loss, from 210 to 180, happened in late high school. It wasn't something I planned. I was such a nerdâ€”with no confidence in my physical abilityâ€”that I don't think I believed weight loss was possible. I can remember having a gut in kindergarten, and my weight problem had only gotten worse from then. So the first time I lost weight, it wasn't something I did on purpose; it happened because of the popularity of [Dance Dance Revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02ndthPNTVM) (DDR) in my school. I've always been a gamer, and for the first time I'd found a form of exercise thatâ€”by way of being a video gameâ€”I neither hated nor found myself bad at.[^2]

I bought a cheap padded dance mat for the Playstation 2 (and later a USB adpater to hook it up to my PC and the software Stepmania), and started playing for half an hour daily. DDR is essentially a form of [high-intensity interval training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training), and playing it was my first introduction to the concept. Each song was roughly 3 minutes, with alternative periods of easier and more intense footwork. A few songs in, and I was sweaty and breathless. But because the game aspect occupied my mind in a way that PE class never did, I was able to keep going song after songâ€”until my brain was telling my feet where to go but they just couldn't get there in time. That's when I'd call it a day. After months of playing, I had lost a lot of weight and [played DDR very well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2ICTbPfrZ0).[^3]

DDR was a high-quality introduction to exercise. I'm still tempted to buy a nice metal dance padâ€”except that I would probably drive my wife mad using it. But DDR alone does not make for a healthy lifestyleâ€”I still ate like crap and didn't really understand anything about fitness. I'd fallen into a good workout routine by accident, and I fell right back out of it when I left for college.

Lots of people complain about the freshmen fifteen, but I mercifully experienced the opposite. By the end of freshman year, I weighed close to 165 pounds. Again, this was an accident. I did not realize at the time what I was doing. What happened? Simply, I was too lazy to eat.

I had no kitchen and only a mini-fridge in my dorm room, so I couldn't keep much food there. And I was usually too engrossed in video games or other computer use to actually go out and pick up something to eat. Freed from my mother's cookingâ€”three large meals a day whether I was hungry or notâ€”I started eating less, and less often. In hindsight, I had begun [time-restricted feeding](https://peterattiamd.com/intermittent-fasting/).[^4] Oversimplified: restricting the times you eat during the day helps to stabilize and reduce insulin throughout the day, allowing your body to use stored fat rather than try to store even more.

I didn't whave a college workout routine. I did pick up the habit of walking, everywhere and often. And that's certainly healthy for body and mind, but the calorie burn from that would have been minimal. My HIIT routine from DDR was gone, and I failed at every other attempt to build a new routine.

Looking back, I really had no idea what I was doing regarding exercise. I would start by going to a campus gym (which I never felt comfortable entering due to self-consciousness around my appearance and lack of knowledge), and usually getting on a treadmill. I have always hated doing steady-state cardio, so of course I had little motivation to show up the first time, much less the second, third, etc. I don't think I ever touched any weights or machines, which I now know I really enjoy.

## Early Career and the Return of Weight

After college, both my diet and physical activity took a hit. Employment is not so leisurely as college, so a lot of the time I had spent walking to the local co-op to get something healthy-ish from the hot bar was replaced with a quick trip to the sandwich place catty-corner to my office, which was aptly named [Potbelly](https://www.potbelly.com/).

I didn't weigh myself for many of these years. When I started weighing in regularly in 2017, I was still hovering around 165 pounds. But by late 2018 I was back to 180 pounds and trending upward. I was very unhappy with my appearance, and I was in a variety of pain from sitting at a desk all day. It was beginning to dawn on me that I was getting older, and that now was the time to make physical fitness a central part of my life if I didn't want to succumb to more pain and illness down the road.

## Getting Fit

I heard it said that no one knows more about fitness than the out-of-shapeâ€”all that time spent reading and learning about fitness rather than just doing it. There's some truth to that. I had been reading about diet and exercise for years, starting with [The 4-Hour Body](https://amzn.to/3tLiMOn) by Tim Ferriss. I'd tried that book's slow-carb diet and even got a kettlebell, but I didn't stick with it long-term.[^5]

But the reading got me thinking about nutrition seriously for the first time in my life, and my mind was finally open to the possibility that I had no idea what I was doing. Whatever I unconsciously thought "nutrition" and "exercise" were, the truth might be completely different. Nothing I'd learned growing up could seriously be considered good diet advice. The cultural baggage I'd inherited from my poor Southern upbringing was weighing me downâ€”literallyâ€”and it was time I dropped it.

### The Worst Diet Advice

If there's one bit of diet advice that drives me nuts, it's "calories in, calories out" (CICO). The idea is, just reduce the calories you eat below what your body burns, and you lose weight. This isn't entirely wrong, but it's an oversimplification the leads to a lot of misery and failed diets.

A major obstacle to weight loss is high insulin. One of insulin's functions is to act as a storage hormone, telling cells to take energy out of the blood and save it for later. Eating triggers insulin release, though in different amounts depending on what and how much you ate. While insulin is high, you can't really use what's in storage in your fat cells.

This is one of the reasons a lot of dieters end up hungry and cold all the time: they are consuming fewer calories, but not lowering insulin. With the body still stuck in storage mode, they can't used stored fat. To compensate, the body lowers metabolic rate.[^6]

This is why I hate it when people talk about CICO: the advice doesn't work if, every time you reduce calories in, your body reduces the calories out in response. Dieters following this advice are "doing everything right", but can't lose weight and physically feel terrible. It's demoralizing. So how to get around this? There are two good ways that can be used independently or in combination: a ketogenic diet and fasting.

### Ketogenic Diet

The ketogenic diet is a good start to addressing the problem of insulin. Carbohydrates stimulate insulin release much more than other macronutrients. Fat barely triggers an insulin release at all. So eating a ketogenic diet can help you avoid chronically high insulin levels that prevent your body from using stored fat.

The ketogenic diet is often described as a "high fat" diet, which is a misleading oversimplification. (There are plenty of studies showing how bad a "high fat" diet is for you, which neglect to emphasize that the diets were *also* high in sugar.) I prefer how it's described in [r/ketogains](https://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/wiki/index#wiki_why_is_macro_breakdown_so_important_for_ketogains.3F): **protein is a goal, carbs are a limit, fat is a lever**. That is to say, you need to hit a protein target to build (or at least not lose) muscle; you need to limit your net carbohydrate intake; and you can hit your calorie targets beyond what you get from protein and carbs with fat. For my ketogenic diet, I calculated target macronutrient intake of â‰¤ 20g of carbohydrate, â‰¥ 100g of protein, and about 110g of fat per day.

The body will preferrentially use consumed carbohydrates as an energy source. Without a lot of exogenous carbohydrates in your diet, the body starts to switch over to using fat as fuel. This fat is broken down into chemicals called ketones, hence the diet's name. You can measure ketones roughly with urine tests or accurately with blood tests; I did neither because my only goal was fat loss, which the scale measured well enough.

Carbohydrates are easy to consume in large quantities on a standard American diet, especially in the form of sugar. Thankfully I already didn't drink soda (a massive source of sugar), nor were breads and pastas a staple of my diet. It wasn't too hard to cut out carbs by just paying more attention to what I was eating. Simple actions, like: don't buy that box of Trader Joe's ice cream sandwiches that you finish in one sitting; choose salads instead of sandwiches for lunch; pass up leftover cookies in the office kitchen; and [track what I eat to keep myself within bounds.](#tracking-the-data) My diet has become one of meat and non-starchy vegetables, which is both flavorful and satiating.

### Fasting

Another approach to reducing insulin is fasting. If you just don't eat, you're not going to release insulin. Eventually the body's hormonal signals switch you over to ketosis. Once you're burning fat, the body still has access to energy and doesn't down-regulate your metabolism. This can be as simple as restricting the times you eat during the day and avoiding snacks, or as intense not eating food for several days.[^7]

The popular label for my time-restricted feeding plan was 18:6, or 18 hours fasted each day with a 6 hour eating window. It's honestly very easy (e.g., lunch and noon and dinner before 6pm, skipping breakfast) and was the longest eating window I could use and still see positive results. 16:8 is another popular window, but I noticed my weight loss stalled if I used it. Sometimes I did extended fasts for an entire day or two, which were helpful for breaking through plateaus. I find it socially difficult to do a 3-day or longer fast.

By eating very few carbs (which trigger insulin release much more than fat), and only eating during a narrow time window (6 hours or less each day), I could keep insulin lower and make it easier for my body to access stored fat for energy. My metabolic rate, as measured by by a resting energy expenditure test in early 2020, is a perfectly normal 1,714 calories per day. I lost weight, and never went through extreme hunger, weakness, tiredness, or cold.

### Tracking the Data

I began regular weight tracking in February of 2017 with a cheap [smart scale](https://amzn.to/3tRuw20), which I'm still using today. I could probably upgrade to something nicer, but this works fine. I weigh myself every morning after using the bathroom. Consistency of circumstnace is importantâ€”it would be hard to understand trends if some days I weigh myself naked and hungry, while others fully dressed and overfed.

The day-to-day weight isn't so important. It can fluctuate for any number of reasons. What matters is seeing the trend, so that I know if I'm going in the desired direction and can correct my behavior if not.

More important than tracking my weight, however, was tracking my diet. I used to use MyFitnessPal, but I felt it was oversimplified and lacked good data on what I ate. The only way to do this fitness journey was by staying true to my nerdy self, and that meant I needed the best data I could getâ€”not just for macronutrients like carbs, protein, and fat, but for all my vitamins and minerals too. I found the perfect diet tracker in [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/).

MyFitnessPal focused on having precisely what you ate in the database, but with low data amount and quality. Cronometer's food database may not have a different entry for every conceiveable permutation of a fast food hamburger, but it's got several very close entries from government databases which will include 77 nutrients. It took a while to get past my perfectionism over logging *exactly* the thing I ate by name and being OK with logging generic versions, but the data I have is on the whole better for it.

For those times when I am eating some specific food all the time, I try to recreate my own version in Cronometer as a custom recipe. With branded and packaged food, I use the available nutrition facts and ingredients list to create a close-enough copy. The benefit of doing this is that, while I might lose a few calories of accuracy, I gain data on dozens of micronutrients that never makes it onto packaging. For foods I make myself, I can just weigh the ingredients as I make it and create a custom recipe that greatly increases data accuraccy and decreases data entry time.

Where Cronometer often fails me is with logging Chinese food. I don't mean that sugary Americanized crap like General Tso's; I mean _real_ Chinese food, which I often eat with my Chinese wife. These delicious meals don't have an English name, much less an entry in a nutrition database from the US or Europe. This is a case where I usually find the nearest Western equivalent and log that. Or if it's something I have a lot and there's no real equivalent, I'll get my wife to help me research it and create a custom recipe.

When I log my food in Cronometer, I usually weigh it first to accurately record how much I'm eating. Just logging a "serving" of a dish often undercounts what you're actually eating. Whenever I'm eating something not pre-packaged (and thus pre-weighed) I use an [OXO Good Grips Food Scale](https://amzn.to/32DYhXU)[^8] to weigh it in grams[^9].

Before logging my food, I had only poor idea of what I ate. But after doing it for years, I acquired good intuition about my food. How much is on the plate, what's the macronutrient breakdown, and how many calories will it be? The answers were once mysteries; but now I make an accurate guess at a glance. Having this knowledge in the back of my mind lets me make good diet choices in the moment.

When weighing myself and logging it, I can see long term trends and adjust behavior. But by weighing food and logging it, I can adjust within the space of a day if I'm going in a bad direction.

### Resistance Training

For approximately the first year of my fitness journey, I explicitly avoided exercise. Body recomposition (losing fat while also gaining muscle) is difficult. And I knew heavy workouts would make me hungry, increasing the difficulty of my diet. I decided to focus initially just on weight loss until I got rid of most of my unwanted fat, and then add it exercise.

I started working out on a regulay basis in 2019, and got more serious about it in 2020. I used to work out in my apartment gym until COVID. Then I used resistance bands in the park. In June 2020, I bought a house; now I've got a simple workout bench and some dumbbells that are fine for most of what I do.

While I used to enjoy HIIT with DDR, it's hard to fit into a busy schedule. HIIT is exhausting, and leaves me a sweaty mess. And outside of DDR, I usually just don't enjoy cardio. I always finish feeling like I got my butt kicked.

Not so with weights, whichâ€”no matter how sore I getâ€”leave me with the sensation that *I* did the butt-kicking. Weights are also easier to do at random throughout the day. I don't need to change into gym clothes to do a quick set of bicep curls, followed by a shower. I frequently do a couple sets while waiting for water to boil for my morning coffee. It just fits into my life better.

Weight loss with keto and fasting was relatively easy and fast. Hypertrophy (muscle growth) is not. Muscles are metabolicly expensive, and the body doesn't want to build them bigger if it can avoid it. It's taken a long time to start to see positive changes in my musculature. But it's very satisfying. I feel fitter than I have in years, maybe ever. For the first time in my life, I can look in the mirror and be proud.

When lifting weights, it's important to have proper form. Doing things sloppily will get you injured, leaving you in a worse state than when you started. I actually recommend looking on YouTube, not for gym exercises, but for physical therapy exercises. These are movements that are going to be safe and are focused on building strength that you're probably missing. It will also help you learn enough anatomy that you can better evaluate other exercises for incorporation into or exclusion from your workout routine.

### Mindset

Understanding the process of weightloss was obviously necessary to achive my results. But most important was correcting my thinking about fitness. Without realizing it, I had internalized that I was just an unfit nerdy guy and that I would never have a good body. That sort of thing just wasn't for guys like me, and I shouldn't even contemplate it. This hidden belief was toxic and held me back for so many years. I'm still working to eradicate it from my mind and undo the damage it did to me.

## TLDR

Lorem ipsum...

[^1]: A few years ago, when my maternal grandmother died, I attended her funeral and saw much of my extened family for the first time in a long time. I was 164 pounds (little of it muscle) at the time, and so comparably thin next to my cousins that people thought I was sick or had cancer. Note that I was in no way skinnyâ€”I still had a gut sticking outâ€”I was just _so much skinnier_ than the others there.

[^2]: Unlike [Bobby Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02ndthPNTVM), by the time I first set foot in Japan, DDR was retro and nowhere to be found. I remain very disappointed that I never got to hustle any Japanese people at DDR, pretending to be a big clumsy gaijin before busting a move.

[^3]: I've tried virtual reality, and it doesn't compare to DDR in terms of intensity. [Thrill of the Fight](https://sealostinteractive.com/) is the only VR game I've played that gets my heart rate high, but it's mostly an arm workout and a bit dangerous if you accidentally punch a wall. [Pistol Whip](https://cloudheadgames.com/pistol-whip/) is an alright squat workout, but does almost nothing to my heart rate. I'm hopefuly more and better fitness games come along with time, but it will be hard to replicate the effects of DDR.

[^4]: Most people call this intermittent fasting, but [I agree with Dr. Peter Attia](https://peterattiamd.com/intermittent-fasting/) that only eating in a narrow range of hours each day isn't much of a fast. No eating for 24 hours or more? That's a fast. Skipping breakfast every day? Mere time-restriction.

[^5]: While he acknowledge the benefits of ketogenic diets (he credits it with helping him recover from long-term symptoms of Lyme disease), Tim Ferriss says he prefers his slow-carb diet to keto because he gets bored of what he's able to eat on keto. Personally, I find keto easier than slow-carb because I can't think of any foods more boring than lentils and beans.

[^6]: Some of the worst dieting advice is "eat many small meals throughout the day." It's bad advice because it keeps your insulin elevated at all times, making it very difficult for your body to access stored fat.

[^7]: The world record is [382 days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Barbieri%27s_fast) without food.

[^8]: The nice thing about the OXO scales is that the display can pull out, so you can still read it when weighing something that's very wide like an oversized plate.

[^9]: I prefer grams for the precision, and because it makes me feel both scientific and international.
