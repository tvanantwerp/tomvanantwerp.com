For a couple of years now, I suspected that I may have [ADHD Inattentive Type](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15253-attention-deficit-disorder-without-hyperactivity-add-in-adults). I first started thinking this while reading a Hacker News thread of programmers with ADHD describing their various non-pharmaceutical interventions that they use to manage their work and lives. The thing that struck me was how many of their strategies were things I'd learned to employ myself. I'm forgetful, so I write todo lists, checklists, and other reminders. I'm distractable, so I wear noise-cancelling headphones and block out external stimuli whenever I can. I have trouble following conversation, being prone to mind-wandering. Did I have ADHD and not know it? Had I learned to do all of these things as a coping mechanism without realizing what I was trying to fix?

Given these apparent deficits and the behaviors I adopted around them, I decided to get properly tested.[^1] After an extremely boring 20 minute [n-back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back) test, I finally have hard data about my liklihood of having ADHD. And the data suggest that I *do not* have ADHD.

The test involved watching a series of colored shapes pop up briefly on a screen. I had to hit the spacebar if the same color and shape showed up twice in a row. My webcam was monitoring eye movement during the test as well.

Compared to average, I was a bit more impulsive (hitting the spacebar when I shouldn't have) than average, but also quicker than average. I'm not sure how a lifetime of playing video games would affect my performance‚Äîsupposedly not at all, but I'm not fully convinced.

The psychologist, upon reviewing my test results with me, put it this way: "I think you're just a smart guy who gets impatient with the perceived slow pace of things. And you're probably too hard on yourself about what you expect to get done."

It's a likely hypothesis. I can be extremely impatient at times. I listen to podcasts and YouTube videos at more than 2x speed because I get bored with the normal pace of speaking. I frequently tune people out when I don't see them taking a conversation someplace interesting or useful, or if they are doing so too slowly. I hate waiting in lines or feeling like I'm running late for things.

When I ran all of this past a friend with an ADHD diagnosis, his first reaction was: "...kinda sounds like ADHD". He also said that his testing took 4 full hours and included many more types of evaluation than n-back, so perhaps it's worth looking into it further.
