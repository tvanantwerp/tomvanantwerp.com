The following is a list of personal directives that, when followed, have improved my life. Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/d1). Again, these are _personal_â€”none of this should necessarily be considered advice for _you_.

## Health

- Limit carbohydrate intake. Try a ketogenic diet (less than 20g total carbs minus fiber daily) if you don't have a known medical reason not to.
- Track your diet (I use [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com)) to make sure you're eating right. You won't really know what you're consuming until you track it.
- Protect sleep.
  - Don't stay up past your bedtime unless it's an emergency.
  - Don't eat before bed.
  - Don't drink before bed.
  - Sleep in the dark, in a slightly cool room.
  - Don't spend time on screens for a few hours before bed.
- Go for walks in lovely places.
- Lift heavy weights with proper form. Form is more important than speed or volume.
- Figure out which climate suits you best and live there.

## Wealth

- Acquire rare and valuable skills to maximize your earning potential.
- Treat people well. Be kind, be honest, and be someone they'll want to work with again in the future.
- Invest in your retirement as much as you can. Max your 401(k) up to the match from your employer, then max your IRA, then completely max your 401(k).
- Use a barbell investing strategy: put the vast majority (90%+) in safe-ish things like a no-load index fund, and use the rest for speculative things (crypto, stock picking, whatever).
- When you want (not _need_, but want) to buy something, wait. If you still want it in a month, OK. Otherwise you probably forgot about it and saved money.
- [Use a password manager](/technical-writing/2021-03-29-all-about-passwords/).
- Learn to work proactively rather than reactively.

## Happiness

- Have deep relationships with good people.
- Cut relationships with bad people.
- Get a dog if your living situation permits it. Even when they destroy your house, you can't help feeling good when you see those cute puppy eyes.
- Design your environment. Add things that bring you joy, remove things that irritate you.
- Get enough sunlight.
