I've been a fan of [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/)'s previous writing about [building career capital](https://amzn.to/3tbuq4v) and [doing deep work](https://amzn.to/3rzJ9px). Since implementing his [time-block planning system](https://youtu.be/eff9h1WYxSo), my personal productivity has increased 2-3x at least. So I was very excited to read *[A World Without Email](https://amzn.to/3ryZPNS)*. Whereas much of Newport's previous work on professional productivity focuses on the individual, this new book examines the entire knowledge work enterprise and how it can be improved.

## The Hyperactive Hive Mind

Since the rise of email in the workplace (and it's siblings like Slack or Microsoft Teams), we office drones have become ever more harried by the demands of constant connection. Always-on work is simultaneously addicting and stressful. Anyone who does knowledge work will be familiar with the feeling. This manner of communicating is what Newport terms the *hyperactive hive mind*.

The hyperactive hive mind wasn't planned. Nobody sat down and decided this was the most efficient way to work. It's an emergent property of the combination of human evolutionary biology and the features of the technology in question.

Humans are extraordinarily social creatures. In our evolutionary environment, it helped tremendously to be on good terms with everyone in the tribe. People who were disliked could end up shunned; and shunned people would probably die before reproducing. This evolutionary pressure created humans who seek to maintain connection and usefulness. We're anxious about missing or ignoring requests from our "tribe", because in eons past that could be the difference between life and death. These anxieties can translate into checking our email every few minutes, just in case.

Now consider a communications medium like email or chat. These tools bring the marginal cost of sending a message to near-zero. And it's easy to loop in numerous participants, whether the message is really useful to them or not. The economics of the tools result in a dramatic increase of sent (and by extension, received) messages.

Combine our human need to stay on top of communicating with tools that turn up the volume of commications to 11, and you've got the hyperactive hive mind: an environment of constant emailing and chatting that stresses us out, but from which we can't extract ourselves. It's become the default way to do knowledge work—not because it's best, but because it's what happens naturally if you don't consciously choose another path.

## Attention Capital Theory

In the industrial world of a century ago, physical capital was the primary asset which had to be successfully deployed to maximize production. Labor was cheap and interchangable—factory equipment was not. So came improvements centered around the deployment of capital. Where once you had individual craftsmen putting together entire products by hand, you now had rigid and efficient workflows enabled by machines and assembly lines.

Physical captial is no longer the main driver of value creation in the contemporary knowledge work economy—brains are. Hence the *attention capital theory*: a knowledge work business needs to deploy brain-power optimally to best compete in the market. If a firm's brain-power is fractured by the hyperactive hive mind—constantly pulled in a million different directions—then it is badly deployed.

Of course, brains can't be organized like machines in a factory.[^1] Peter Drucker wrote in his 1967 book *The Effective Executive* that knowledge workers can't be directed like factory workers—they must direct themselves. You can give a factory worker precise instructions to build a widget, but you cannot give a scientist precise instructions to cure cancer. Knowledge work requires thought and creativity, and you cannot extract their products on demand.

But Newport argues that this is not entirely accurate. There are many aspects of knowledge work which do *not* require gifts from the Muse (e.g., the book's eponymous email), and these aspects ought to be standardized within a business. By clarifying how knowledge work is organized, workers can direct more of their attention to value-producing mental efforts over wasteful *ad hoc* administration.

## Do Better Than Default

Any system can do better than the hyperactive hive mind if it has two qualities:

- Minimize context switching
- Minimize communication overload

The human mind works best when working on one thing at a time, pulling all relevant information into working memory. Switching back and forth between unrelated tasks results in dumping and recalling all of that mental context again and again. This is expensive in terms of time and mental energy. If you're constantly checking email for new messages, you're engaged in endless context switching and your ability to produce work requiring deep focus is greatly diminished.

Of course, part of the reason that you're constantly context switching to inbound communications is that they are incessant and demanding! You never know if the latest **ping** is an "urgent" request to drop everything and do something else—better check it to be safe! Minimizing context switching thus requires getting inbound messages under control as well.

Newport spends the rest of the book covering a number of strategies for reducing context switching and structuring communication to avoid overload.

### Workflows

{% figure './img/2021-03-08-jared-scrum.jpg', 'The character Jared from the show Silicon Valley explains a Scrum task board to Pied Piper employees.', 'Source: <a href="https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silicon Valley</a>' %}

#### Task Boards

Task boards are a simple way to visually keep track of work to be done in a project. 

#### Scrum

#### Automation
- Task boards
    - Works for teams and individuals
    - Customize to suit needs
- Scrums for teams, or regular reviews for individuals\
- Automation
    - Partitioning
    - Signaling
    - Channeling

### Protocols

- Similar to my ideas on borders and interfaces
- Clear rules around how certain information is communicated
    - Some added complexity upfront adds huge efficiencies through lower average message size
- Tradeoff between cognitive cycles used and convenience
- Use meeting scheduling services like calendly
- Try an office hours approach
- Have clear protocols for outsiders too
- Try non-personal email addresses
- Clear protocols to keep meetings focused and short

### Specialization

Many business have used the cost savings of digital tools to reduce support costs. Why hire a secretary to file the salesman's expense reports when you can tell him to upload pictures of receipts on a web portal? But this line of thinking has gone so far that many people are bogged down with a plethora of just-easy-enough administrative tasks.

- Specialists have been doing more admin work on PCs because it's just easy enough, so support staff aren't hired
- Comparative advantage tells us this is dumb, hire support staff instead
- Outsource things that you are bad at
- Many of the things that help the specialists help support staff too
    - Clarity of workflows
    - Clarity of interfaces
