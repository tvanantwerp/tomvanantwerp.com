I've been a fan of [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/)'s previous writing about [building career capital](https://amzn.to/3tbuq4v) and [doing deep work](https://amzn.to/3rzJ9px). Since implementing his [time-block planning system](https://youtu.be/eff9h1WYxSo), my personal productivity has increased 2-3x at least. So I was very excited to read *[A World Without Email](https://amzn.to/3ryZPNS)*. Whereas much of Newport's previous work on professional productivity focuses on the individual, this new book examines the entire knowledge work enterprise and how it can be improved.

### The Hyperactive Hive Mind

Since the rise of email in the workplace (and it's siblings like Slack or Microsoft Teams), we office drones have become ever more harried by the demands of constant connection. Always-on work is simultaneously addicting and stressful. Anyone who does knowledge work will be familiar with the feeling. This manner of communicating is what Newport terms the *hyperactive hive mind*.

The hyperactive hive mind wasn't planned. Nobody sat down and decided this was the most efficient way to work. It's an emergent property of the combination of human evolutionary biology and the features of the technology in question.

Humans are extraordinarily social creatures. In our evolutionary environment, it helped tremendously to be on good terms with everyone in the tribe. People who were asocial or didn't help out could end up shunned. And shunned people were much more likely to die before reproducing. The evolutionary pressure created humans who seek to maintain connection and usefulness. We're anxious about missing or ignoring requests from our "tribe", because in eons past that could be the difference between life and death. These anxieties translate into checking our email every few minutes, just in case.

Now combine that with a communications medium like email or chat. These tools bring the marginal cost of sending a message to near-zero. And it's easy to loop in numerous participants, whether the message is really useful to them or not. The economics of the tools result in a dramatic increase of outbound (and by extension, inbound) communication.

Combine our human need to stay on top of communicating with tools that turn up the volume of commications to 11, and you've got the hyperactive hive mind: and environment of constant emailing and chatting that stresses us out but which we can't extract ourselves from.

### Attention Capital Theory

- Industrialists deployed machines. Knowledge businesses deploy brains.
- Businesses that can leverage focused attention from specialists have an advantage against distracted competitors.

In the industrial world of a century ago, physical capital was the primary asset which had to be successfully deployed to maximize production. Labor was cheap and interchangable—factory equipment was not. So came improvements centered around the deployment of capital. Where once you had individual craftsmen putting together entire products by hand, you now had rigid and efficient workflows enabled by machines and assembly lines.

Knowledge work isn't like factory work. In knowledge work, brains are the expensive input. And brains can't be organized like machines in a factory. (It gets messy, and they don't work so well when spread across a concrete floor.) Peter Drucker wrote in his 1967 book *The Effective Executive* that knowledge workers can't be directed like factory workers—they must direct themselves.

Newport argues that this is not entirely accurate. It's true that while you can give a factory worker precise instructions to build a widget, you cannot give a researcher precise instructions to cure cancer. Knowledge work requires thought and creativity, and you cannot extract their products on demand. But there are many aspects of knowledge work which do *not* require gifts from the Muse (e.g., the book's eponymous email), and these aspects both can and should be standardized within a business. By clarifying processes and rules around communications, knowledge workers can direct more of their attention to value-producing mental efforts.

### Workflows

- Task boards
    - Works for teams and individuals
    - Customize to suit needs
- Scrums for teams, or regular reviews for individuals\
- Automation
    - Partitioning
    - Signaling
    - Channeling

### Protocols

- Similar to my ideas on borders and interfaces
- Clear rules around how certain information is communicated
    - Some added complexity upfront adds huge efficiencies through lower average message size
- Tradeoff between cognitive cycles used and convenience
- Use meeting scheduling services like calendly
- Try an office hours approach
- Have clear protocols for outsiders too
- Try non-personal email addresses
- Clear protocols to keep meetings focused and short

### Specialization

- Specialists have been doing more admin work on PCs because it's just easy enough, so support staff aren't hired
- Comparative advantage tells us this is dumb, hire support staff instead
- Outsource things that you are bad at
- Many of the things that help the specialists help support staff too
    - Clarity of workflows
    - Clarity of interfaces
