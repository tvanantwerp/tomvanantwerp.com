Intro

### The Hyperactive Hive Mind

- What is it?
- How did this happen?
- This goes against our biology.

### Attention Capital Theory

- Industrialists deployed machines. Knowledge businesses deploy brains.
- Businesses that can leverage focused attention from specialists have an advantage against distracted competitors.

In the industrial world of a century ago, physical capital was the primary asset which had to be successfully deployed to maximize production. Labor was cheap and interchangable—factory equipment was not. So came improvements centered around the deployment of capital. Where once you had individual craftsmen putting together entire products by hand, you now had rigid and efficient workflows enabled by machines and assembly lines.

Knowledge work isn't like factory work. In knowledge work, brains are the expensive input. And brains can't be organized like machines in a factory. (It gets messy, and they don't work so well when spread across a concrete floor.) Peter Drucker wrote in his 1967 book *The Effective Executive* that knowledge workers can't be directed like factory workers—they must direct themselves.

Newport argues that this is not entirely accurate. It's true that while you can give a factory worker precise instructions to build a widget, you cannot give a researcher precise instructions to cure cancer. Knowledge work requires thought and creativity, and you cannot extract their products on demand. But there are many aspects of knowledge work which do _not_ require gifts from the Muse (e.g., the book's eponymous email), and these aspects both can and should be standardized within a business. By clarifying processes and rules around communications, knowledge workers can direct more of their attention to value-producing mental efforts.

### Workflows

- Task boards
    - Works for teams and individuals
    - Customize to suit needs
- Scrums for teams, or regular reviews for individuals\
- Automation
    - Partitioning
    - Signaling
    - Channeling

### Protocols

- Similar to my ideas on borders and interfaces
- Clear rules around how certain information is communicated
    - Some added complexity upfront adds huge efficiencies through lower average message size
- Tradeoff between cognitive cycles used and convenience
- Use meeting scheduling services like calendly
- Try an office hours approach
- Have clear protocols for outsiders too
- Try non-personal email addresses
- Clear protocols to keep meetings focused and short

### Specialization

- Specialists have been doing more admin work on PCs because it's just easy enough, so support staff aren't hired
- Comparative advantage tells us this is dumb, hire support staff instead
- Outsource things that you are bad at
- Many of the things that help the specialists help support staff too
    - Clarity of workflows
    - Clarity of interfaces
